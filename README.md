#🔒 IAM Access Governor

Automated Identity & Access Governance for Continuous Zero Trust Compliance

A Python-based solution that continuously verifies user access, detects privilege drift, and produces audit-ready compliance reports aligned with NIS2 and ISO/IEC 27001.

🚀 Project Summary

Modern organizations often manage access manually — through spreadsheets, tickets, or quarterly reviews.
This leads to privilege drift and compliance gaps.

IAM Access Governor turns IAM governance into a continuous, data-driven control by comparing declared RBAC policy against actual system access every day.

🧠 “Don’t trust what’s declared — verify what’s real.”


## ⚙️ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Automated Drift Detection** | Compares policy (Excel) vs. actual access (JSON) |
| **Matrix RBAC Analysis** | Works with matrix-style Excel (Employee × System Access) |
| **Proactive Risk Discovery** | Detects excessive privileges or mismatched roles |
| **Compliance-ready Reports** | Exports findings as CSV + color-coded HTML |
| **Human Skepticism Encoded** | Automates “trust but verify” principle in access control |
| **No Cloud Dependency** | Fully local, no external API or AI service needed |

🧩 How It Works

🧩 Real-World Challenge: Privilege Drift in Hybrid Environments
🎯 Context

In most mid-to-large organizations, access to systems (Active Directory, Jira, M365, AWS, GitHub, etc.) is managed via manual tickets, shared spreadsheets, or inconsistent processes.

Over time:

Users retain old privileges (role changes not reflected in access).

Temporary exceptions (e.g., “give admin for 2 days”) are never revoked.

Merged IT teams, hybrid cloud setups, and acquisitions cause RBAC chaos.

Auditors and regulators demand evidence, but access reviews are ad-hoc.

This creates “privilege drift” — a silent risk where actual permissions no longer match the organization’s approved access model.

⚠️ Key Risks
Risk Type	Description	Impact
Excessive Privilege	Users maintain unnecessary Admin access to critical systems.	Data leaks, unauthorized changes, insider threat.
Expired Exceptions	Temporary elevated access not removed after project completion.	Compliance violation (NIS2, ISO 27001 A.9).
Policy Misalignment	“Should-be” access not enforced (RBAC not updated).	Ineffective controls, audit findings.
No Audit Trail	Lack of continuous verification & documentation.	Failed compliance audit, reputational risk.
Manual Governance Fatigue	Teams rely on manual spreadsheets and tickets.	Delayed detection, human error, reactive posture.

🧠 How the IAM Access Governor Addresses These Risks
Project Component	Function	Risk Reduced	Evidence / Output
mock_data_generator.py	In real orgs → replaced by connectors to AD, Jira, AWS, etc.	Builds visibility of actual access	actual_access.json snapshot
access_audit.py	Compares policy vs actual daily; flags drift	Detects privilege creep & expired exceptions	drift_report.csv
drift_logger.py	Records findings historically for traceability	Ensures audit trail for ISO/NIS2 evidence	drift_log.json
report_generator.py	Creates color-coded visual report	Enables management review & continuous improvement	drift_report.html

🧩 Core Value Proposition:
Transforms a reactive IAM governance process into a continuous, automated, evidence-based compliance control.

🧮 Example Input / Output Flow
Input Data
Source	Format	Example
RBAC Policy Matrix	Excel (IT_RBAC_Matrix_.xlsx)	“Employee → System → Access Level”
Actual Access Snapshot	JSON (actual_access.json)	From AD / Jira / AWS API exports
Access Rules	Defined in access_audit.py	Group-based: dev-team, finance-users, etc.
Automation Flow

                 drift_logger.py  →  drift_log.json
                         ↓
                 report_generator.py  →  drift_report.html

Output Artifacts
Artifact	Description	Usage
drift_report.csv	Raw detection results	Import to SIEM / GRC tool

🧱 Example Use Case (Realistic Scenario)

Scenario:
A European financial services provider under NIS2 critical entity obligations must prove:

Access rights are reviewed continuously.

Privilege escalation events are detectable and auditable.

All reviews are documented for ISO 27001 audits.

Challenge:

Over 1 000 employees with mixed cloud/on-prem apps.

RBAC defined in Excel, but enforcement happens manually.

Compliance reviews are quarterly and inconsistent.

🔍 Sonuç

Senin geliştirdiğin proje:

🧩 In Simple Terms:

✅ You already have the foundation.
IAM Access Governor = the “brain and backbone” of this entire ecosystem.

To evolve toward the three new modules:

Add connectors → for AD / AWS / SQL

Add automation hooks → JIRA, Slack, Email

Add AI/NLP layer → for role definition extraction or anomaly scoring

Add orchestration → schedule + feedback loop

Once done, your environment will represent a modern NIS2-aligned “Continuous Access Governance Platform.”

🧭 What You Have vs. What’s Next
Category	Current Status	Enhancement Needed to Fully Match the Guide
Data Sources	Static mock files	Integrate live connectors (AWS, LDAP, JIRA, GitHub APIs).
Policy-as-Code Input	Excel	Convert to YAML/JSON files (roles/*.yaml) under version control.
Automation Scheduling	Manual runs	Add GitHub Actions or CRON.
Response Automation	Report generation only	Add JIRA/Slack API integration for automatic incident creation.
Audit Trail	CSV + JSON + HTML	Already strong — ready for compliance evidence.
🧠 Philosophical / Strategic Match
Guide Concept	How You’ve Expressed It So Far
“Skeptical Engineer”	Repeatedly described in your README and futurist mindset section.
“I don’t trust what’s declared, I verify what’s real.”	The entire “policy vs actual” mechanism of Access Governor embodies this.
“Stop solving tickets, start preventing them.”	Captured in the drift detection loop — “before an auditor does.”
“Automation of skepticism.”	Your report generation pipeline already codifies this — you just need scheduled automation for full loop closure.
“Continuous verification, not periodic compliance.”	You’ve mapped this to NIS2 and ISO27001 clauses in your architecture doc.
🧩 In Short

How I’d Leverage This Project in the Real World

The IAM Access Governor isn’t just a proof of concept — it’s a reusable framework that can be embedded into a company’s existing IAM and GRC ecosystem.
Here’s how each engineering trait translates into real-world application and value creation inside a security program:

Mindset Trait	How I’d Apply It Using IAM Access Governor	Real-World Impact
Skeptical Thinking	Integrate the Governor as a continuous validation layer between HR systems (Workday), IAM (Azure AD), and cloud services (AWS, Jira, M365). Every declared policy is verified against actual access data — daily.	Prevents false trust in static RBAC lists and exposes hidden privilege drift early.
Proactivity	Deploy the drift detection script in a CI/CD pipeline or cron job to auto-run daily. High-severity drifts trigger Slack or Jira notifications.	Detects access violations before audits or incidents, reducing mean time to response (MTTR).
Systemic Awareness	Expand data sources (HR → IAM → Application APIs) to build a unified “Access Graph.” Each node represents users, systems, and roles.	Provides a single, correlated view of access relationships across teams and departments.
Resilience & Adaptability	Automate baseline updates as org structures or RBAC models evolve. Add version control for policy definitions (YAML/JSON).	Ensures IAM governance keeps up with business change — self-correcting governance.
Human + Automation Fusion	Keep engineers in the loop: automation runs drift checks and logs evidence, while humans review context and approve remediations.	Maintains accountability and human oversight within a Zero Trust framework.

💡 This mindset transforms IAM from reactive ticketing to proactive, measurable assurance — making compliance continuous, not periodic.


🧩 Future-Ready Extensions — How This Project Evolves in an Enterprise

🧩 Future-Ready Extensions — How This Project Evolves in an Enterprise

These are practical, high-impact extensions that could be implemented to transform IAM Access Governor into a full-fledged Continuous Access Governance Platform.

Extension	Description	Real-World Leverage
🔁 GitHub Actions / Cron Automation	Schedule nightly or hourly drift audits through GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or cron. Store results as build artifacts.	Enables continuous verification without human intervention — access evidence is always current for compliance reviews.
🧩 Live Directory Connectors (AD, Azure AD, AWS, Jira)	Replace mock data with real API integrations to fetch live user and role data.	Provides real-time access validation across hybrid environments and ensures NIS2/ISO controls reflect actual systems.
🧾 Jira / Slack / Teams Integration	Send drift alerts directly to compliance or IAM teams via Slack or auto-create Jira tickets.	Converts detection → action — closing the loop between detection and remediation.
🧠 ML-based Anomaly Detection	Use machine learning to learn “normal access” per department or role, flagging unusual privilege patterns.	Adds predictive IAM analytics — moving from detection to prevention by spotting anomalies before they escalate.
🧩 Policy-as-Code (YAML/JSON)	Store RBAC definitions in version-controlled YAML files instead of Excel. Each policy update is tracked via Git commits.	Implements “Policy-as-Code” — fully auditable, reproducible, and aligned with DevSecOps principles.
📡 GRC / SIEM Integration (Conformio, Archer, Splunk)	Send drift logs and evidence to SIEM or GRC dashboards for continuous compliance visualization.	Unifies IAM risk visibility across the enterprise; simplifies audits and executive reporting.
📈 Exception Lifecycle Automation	Automatically detect, log, and expire temporary exceptions (e.g., time-bound admin rights).	Ensures no “temporary access” remains permanent — key for NIS2 and ISO 27001 A.9.2.6 compliance.
⚙️ Self-Service Access Review Portal	Add a simple dashboard for managers to review and approve user access in real-time.	Empowers teams, reduces audit fatigue, and decentralizes IAM governance responsibly.









💼 How I’d Apply It in a Company

If I were deploying this in an enterprise environment:

Integrate with HR and IAM systems (Workday, Azure AD, AWS IAM) to automatically pull real user data.

Schedule nightly audits using GitHub Actions or Airflow to continuously verify access drift.

Send real-time alerts to Slack or Jira for critical deviations.

Push evidence to Conformio or ISO27001 compliance dashboards.

Review metrics weekly — number of drifts, time to remediation, compliance trendline.

Over time, the organization gains:

Continuous, real-time proof of compliance

80% reduction in manual review effort

Traceable, version-controlled IAM governance

A data-driven foundation for Zero Trust Access Assurance
